# Beauty of Annihilation Call of Cthulhu Campaign Organizer
I wanted to organize my Call of Cthulhu game a bit better, and most of the notes apps didn't give me the organization I wanted. I am hoping to make this website organize my game better. Should it prove quite useful and robust, I will consider launching a version that helps you build a campaign/game on your own, with no code to be friendly to my fellow RPG tabletop fans

# What is Call of Cthulhu
Call of Cthulhu is a role playing game, similar to Dungeons and Dragons for the uninitiated. While I am considerably new to this game, it is about cosmic and eldritch horrors, with an emphasis on dread and terror, contradicting the often uplifting or heroic themes of D&D. In designing a game or campaign, there are many aspects to consider, including the world, (from my naive perspective, it appears most games take place on earth, rather than another world, as can be more common in D&D). 

History and lore of the world can be quite different if needed, but for my game, I am keeping the general history of Earth, and most games take place a bit more in the future compared to D&D, in the 19th and 20th centuries, generally the 1920s are used in the games I have played. 

# Wrapping Up
Thanks for viewing this Repo, I hope that this website, or some variant more suitable for reading, rather than organizing my personal game, may be published and viewable in the future.
